**Project Title:**

&emsp;Hangman (Vehicle Edition)


**Project Description:** *(Currently copied from Phase 0)

&emsp;Users will have to guess the correct words in increasing difficulty. Game does not end until the user runs out of tries. For example, if the user guesses one word, but loses a few lives, then they go to the next round with the same number of lives left.. (Alternatively, you can restore a life word every 3 words guessed successfully).


**Functional Requirements:**

&emsp;•	Users will open the game and be presented with a screen that shows a title as well as an option to read the rules or start the game 

&emsp;•	Background music and/or sound effects will be present in the waiting area. 

&emsp;•	Once the game starts users will be presented with an empty case of words in which they will have to guess to move on

&emsp;•	The randomized options are picked out from an array of many words 

&emsp;•	Users can click letter buttons and as they are pressed, they will become disabled

&emsp;•	If the letter pressed is wrong, the user will lose a life. The user has 5 lives

&emsp;•	If the user is able to guess 3 words correctly they will gain a life back

&emsp;•	As the user continues to guess words correctly the difficulty level will increase as well 

&emsp;•	User will have a local leaderboard to keep track off their scores

&emsp;•	When the user uses up all of their lives the game will end 

&emsp;•	User may also use a quit option when they no longer want to play 

&emsp;•	All options of leaving the game or ending will bring you back to the waiting area (main page)

&emsp;• An image will be built on to indicate depleted lives as lives decrement
